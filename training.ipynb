What is the probability of getting heads on at least one of the ten flips?\\nTo determine the probability of getting heads in exactly 8 out of 10 flips for a fair coin, we use the binomial probability formula:\\n\\\\[ P(X = k) = \\\\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}, \\\\]\\nwhere \\\\( n = 10 \\\\), \\\\( k = 8 \\\\), and \\\\( p = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).
